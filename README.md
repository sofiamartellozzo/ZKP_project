# Zero Knowledge Proof Research Project

This repository contains the research and implementations for the "Zero Knowledge Proof" project, completed for the course "Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies: Principles, Applications, and Research Challenges" under the supervision of Professor Bruschi Francesco at Politecnico di Milano.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore the principles and applications of Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) within the context of blockchain technology. The project includes a comprehensive research document, a presentation of the findings, and practical simulations demonstrating ZKP with a Merkle Tree structure.

## Contents

- **ZKP_in_blockchain.pdf**: This document contains the main research on Zero Knowledge Proofs, discussing its principles, uses in blockchain technology, and potential future applications.

- **Presentation**: A set of slides used for the class presentation, summarizing the research findings and the theoretical aspects of ZKP.

- **MerkleTree.py**: A Python script that simulates the Merkle Tree data structure, which is integral to implementing ZKP in a blockchain context.

- **automatic_proof.py**: A script that demonstrates a practical problem solved using ZKP within a Merkle Tree structure. This simulation shows how ZKP can be used to verify the integrity of data without revealing the data itself.

- **KZG_ceremony.pdf**: A supplementary document focusing on the KZG polynomial commitment scheme, exploring its significance and usage in ZKP technologies.

## Usage

To run the Python scripts, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). After installing Python, you can run each script using the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python <script_name>.py
```
